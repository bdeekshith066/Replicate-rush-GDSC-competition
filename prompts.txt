## PROMPT 1

Hi ChatGPT,

I'm participating in an event called Replicate Rush, where I'll be using ChatGPT 3.5 to build a website provided by the organizers. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations below, as they outline the guidelines for this competition. The participants who can replicate the website with fewer prompts will be declared winners.

Rules and Regulations:

1. Participants are not required to bring their own laptops or devices; the event organizers will provide necessary computing resources and tools.
2. ChatGPT 3.5 is the sole model allowed for this event.
3. Each participant is limited to a specific number of attempts to instruct the model for website replication.
4. A specified time limit is enforced to ensure a fair and competitive environment.
5. The replicated website should closely resemble the provided reference website in terms of layout, design, and content.
6. Basic functionalities of the reference website, such as navigation menus, links, and interactive elements, should be replicated.
7. Any form of cheating or using external tools, except the allowed model, is strictly prohibited.
8. Evaluation of the replicated websites will be conducted by a panel of judges based on predefined criteria.
9. Judges' decisions are final and binding.

Additionally, please ensure not to deviate from the instructions provided and focus on accuracy. Now, let's get started by setting up the basic structure for the homepage. Replicate the layout and key elements as closely as possible to the reference website.

Thank you, and let's begin!

For the start of Replicate Rush, let's focus on the homepage's basic structure. Generate HTML, CSS, and JS codes to create a layout that closely resembles the reference website. Include a header, navigation menu, and a main content section. Ensure a clean and responsive design, utilizing a background color of #f0f0f0 for the body. Pay attention to accuracy in replicating the reference site's key elements.
